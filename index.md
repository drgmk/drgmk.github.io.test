I am a Data Scientist at the [Malaghan Institute of Medical Research](https://www.malaghan.org.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand. I use various methods to analyse data from biological experiments, helping us better understand the immune system and how it can be harnessed to fight disease. 

For two decades before this (2005-2025), I was an Astronomer. I did my PhD at the ANU in Canberra, Australia, and then moved to the UK for 16 years, starting as a postdoc at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I was a Royal Society University Research Fellow for nearly ten years, and after leaving the IoA was an Associate Professor based in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics Group](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro) at the [University of Warwick](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk), UK.
