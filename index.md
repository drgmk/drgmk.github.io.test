I am an Associate Professor based in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics Group](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro) at the [University of Warwick](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk), UK.

Along with others in the [disk group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/research/discs/), I work on various theoretical and observational aspects of planet formation and the end results - planets and debris disks - as seen around nearby stars. This includes transiting dust populations, what debris disks tell us about the alignment of orbits in stellar and planetary systems, and the possible impact of exo-Zodiacal dust on future missions to image Earth-like planets around other stars.

I am/have been involved in many collaborations, including large surveys such as ALMA ARKS, ALMA REASONS, LBTI HOSTS, NaCo ISPY, Herschel DEBRIS, JCMT SONS, and Spitzer SpiKeS. The many publications from these and other studies are [here](pub).

Our recent papers:
* _vis-r: Quick radial profile modelling for radio interferometric visibilities_, Kennedy 2025
* _Modelling a Transiting Circumbinary Disc in the HD98800 System_, Faruqi et al. 2025
* _Quantifying spectroscopic Ca II exocomet transit occurrence in two decades of HARPS data_, Bendahan-West et al. 2025
* _The characterisation of water ice in debris discs: implications for JWST scattered light observations_, Kim et al. 2024
* _A planetary collision afterglow and transit of the resultant debris cloud_, Kenworthy et al. 2023
* _An ALMA Survey of M-dwarfs in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group with Two New Debris Disc Detections_, Cronin-Coltsmann et al. 2023
* _ALMA and Keck analysis of Fomalhaut field sources: JWST's Great Dust Cloud is a background object_, Kennedy et al. 2023
* _ALMA's view of the M-dwarf GSC 07396-00759's edge-on debris disc: AU Mic's coeval twin_, Cronin-Coltsmann et al., 2022
