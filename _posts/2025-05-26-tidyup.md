I have now left the UK and Warwick, so some of the related web pages can be found at the following links:
- [Computing](/computing/) (SCRTP, Mac setup)
- [Teaching](/teaching/) (Cosmology, Interferometry)

As a quick history:

I was an Associate Professor based in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics Group](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro) at the [University of Warwick](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk), UK.

Along with others in the [disk group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/research/discs/), I work on various theoretical and observational aspects of planet formation and the end results - planets and debris disks - as seen around nearby stars. This includes transiting dust populations, what debris disks tell us about the alignment of orbits in stellar and planetary systems, and the possible impact of exo-Zodiacal dust on future missions to image Earth-like planets around other stars.

I am/have been involved in many collaborations, including large surveys such as ALMA ARKS, ALMA REASONS, LBTI HOSTS, NaCo ISPY, Herschel DEBRIS, JCMT SONS, and Spitzer SpiKeS. The many publications from these and other studies are [here](pub).
